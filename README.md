To follow the projectâ€™s requirements, I thought the best project for this would be to make a task manager or to-do list, since it requires the fetching of tasks and the function to delete or add tasks. I figured the easiest way to begin was to start working on the Django project using the REST framework, since the frontend will be pulling from the Django project itself.
To begin this process, we need to install python, which can be done by going to their website and getting the installer. But for me, since I am on Linux Manjaro, we can simply use the package manager that it uses, called pacman, to install python. Alternatively, there is a UI version of the package installer and can be downloaded there. After we are done there, the rest needs to be done in a virtual environment for python to install all of its dependencies for Django.
